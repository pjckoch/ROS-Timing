# ROS-Timing
This repository serves to analyze the and control the timing of the Robotic-Infant system which I am working on for my bachelor thesis. 

The repository contains two packages:
- **timing_analysis**: Examine the timing of a publisher-subscriber-pair.
- **msg_sync**: Subscribe to multiple asynchronous topics and re-publish them in sync.

For further details, refer to the [timing_analysis README.md](timing_analysis/README.md) and the [msg_sync README.md](msg_sync/README.md).
